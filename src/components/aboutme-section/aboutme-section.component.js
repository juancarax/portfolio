      Hi!, my name is Juan Garc√≠a and I'm starting my career in tech industry as
      a web developer. Currently I'm in my third year in University, pursuing a
      degree in Computer Science. <br /> <br /> I'm a well-organized person,
      passionate about self-growth, always motivated and eager to learn
      something new every day. When not coding I spend my time reading,
      listening to music and playing videogames with friends!
